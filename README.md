# Prince of Songkla portal

This repository contains all the useful tools and information that I think will help one succeed and do better work as an employee of Prince of Songkla University. Pull requests are always welcome. 

Since I am still the main contributor (last I checked), most things are written from a perspective of a researcher at Phuket Campus. If you find things that are not relevant to your campuses, please let me know.
